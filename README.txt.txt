AI Rubik's Cube Solver
Senior Project Spring 2024

DESCRIPTION:
---------------
This program allows for a user to solve a Rubik's cube after inputting the Rubik's cube configuration into a webpage.  There are two different options for solving the cube available to the user which include the Magiccube library (with altered coding) and the OpenAI option.

INSTRUCTIONS:
---------------
In order to use this program, the user must first open the HTML page and enter in the correct colors for the faces of the Rubik's cube the user is trying to solve.  After doing this, the user then clicks the submit button and the page opens a popup that confirms what the user entered, but in cube notation format.  The HTML file also allows for a downloadable txt file to be generated containing this input for the user.  

This txt file will then be used by the second program file the user will open, which is the main .py file (the one with the magiccube library).  After opening this program and running it, the program will automatically find the .txt file that was generated from the previous program, and use it as the input for the code.  The program will solve the cube and output the moves it performed to solve it as well as visual representations of the cube in the console window.  If the user performs these moves on their cube, they will solve it.  

Alternatively, the user can also decide to run the .py file containing the code for the OpenAI option.  This option is trained using different webpages gathered containing information and tutorials for how to solve a Rubik's cube and, as such, it isn't 100% accurate.  However, the user can still input their cube notation in the format that was displayed in the .txt file that was generated by the first HTML program, and the AI will attempt to use the tutorial pages it was fed to solve it and output what moves it performed and whether or not it thinks it was successful.
